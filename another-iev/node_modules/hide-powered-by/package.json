  "readme": "Hide X-Powered-By\n=================\n\nSimple middleware to remove the `X-Powered-By` HTTP header if it's set.\n\nHackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express (or whichever framework you use). For example, `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every HTTP request coming from Express, by default.\n\nThe `hidePoweredBy` middleware will remove the `X-Powered-By` header if it is set (which it will be by default in Express).\n\n```javascript\nvar hidePoweredBy = require('hide-powered-by');\napp.use(hidePoweredBy());\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly set the header to something else, if you want. This could throw people off:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }));\n```\n\nNote: if you're using Express, you can skip this middleware if you want:\n\n```javascript\napp.disable('x-powered-by');\n```\n",
